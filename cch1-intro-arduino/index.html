  <h1>Chapter 1: introduction to the Arduino</h1>

  <p>This first chapter introduces the Arduino -- a tiny computer that is often used to control all kinds of hardware, including robots, drones and art-installations.</p>

  <div class="attention">
    <p>After the video below, we're going to ask you two things:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Tell us what words, terms, phrases in the video you did not fully understand.</li>
        <li>Write a quick summary of the video, to show which parts you did understand.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>So, before you start watching the video, make sure you have a texteditor or a physical notepad ready to use. <b>Make notes for your summary, and write down all the words you did not understand.</b></p>

<h2>Why learn Arduino?</h2>
<p>The Arduino is one of the most <i>under</i>powered computers you can buy today. Its processor is slow, and it has very little memory (2Kb!). And yet, it is quite popular with both nerds and artists. This is because of three reasons:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>It is cheap.</b> At the time of writing, an 'official' Arduino costs a little over 20 euros. Chinese clones can be found for about 5 dollars, and such clones are not flakey fakes: the hardware design of the Arduino is public, and free for everyone to use, and so are the software tools to program Arduino and its clones.</li>
  <li><b>It is easy</b> to connect all kinds of electronics to an Arduino. With many similar little computers (and big ones), you have to solder wires to the circuit board, or use complex programming tools to get anything working. Usually both. With Arduino neither: just plug in some wires.</li>
  <li><b>It is relatively easy</b> to write programs that make the electronics do fun or important stuff. You don't need to study programming for months or years to get going. The amount of things you need to learn to master the Arduino is a lot less than most programming systems.</li>
</ul>
<p>For this course, there is another reason why Arduino is very interesting. While there are thousands of programming languages, almost all of the mainstream languages fit on a spectrum that has Javascript on one end, and Arduino's programming language (C++) on the other end. If you want, or need, to learn a different language, say PHP, Swift, Java, or Python, you will find that many (if not all) aspects of this new language are either similar to Javascript, or similar to Arduino C++ (or a bit of both). And by seeing the many similarities between Arduino and Javascript, you are learning the properties that are fundamental fundamental to most other languages.</p>
<p>By teaching you both Javascript and Arduino, <b>we are preparing you for programming in almost all other useful programming languages.</b> No introductory course that uses just one language can do that just as effectively. And this course could not do this <i>in a fun way</i> without the Arduino.</p>
<p>How much fun is the Arduino? That is, basically, up to you. But have a look at these two video's, that show some Arduino projects, and give you a sense of what Arduino enthusiasts like to use it for:</p>

      <script type="text/plain" class="language-arduino">

      <p>For the scientology church, we are building their new so called "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-meter" target="_blank">E-meter</a>" using our arduino's magnet sensor. </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Make sure to include your s4d_breadboard.h file in your project.</li>
        <li>Experiment with the magnetsensor. What happens to the value when the magnet is near? What happens when the magnet is far?<note>Deze eerste twee bullits een andere opdracht laten zijn.</note></li>
        <li>Modify the provided code so the light blinks a bit faster when the magnet is near.</li>
        <li>Can you think of a trick (calculation) that would amplify the difference <note>"amplify difference" lijkt me niet begrijpelijk genoeg.</note>between the sensor being close and far?<note>Try to implement your trick. If that fails, just describe your idea in comments in the program.</note></li>
