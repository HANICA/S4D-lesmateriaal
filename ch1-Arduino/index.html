  <h1>Chapter 1: Introduction to the Arduino</h1>

  <p>This first chapter introduces the Arduino -- a tiny computer that is often used to control all kinds of hardware, including robots, drones and art-installations.</p>

  <div class="attention">
    <p>After the video below, we're going to ask you two things:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Tell us what words, terms, phrases in the video you did not fully understand.</li>
        <li>Write a quick summary of the video, to show which parts you did understand.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>So, before you start watching the video, make sure you have a texteditor or a physical notepad ready to use. <b>Make notes for your summary, and write down all the words you did not understand.</b></p>

      <p>For the scientology church, we are building their new so called "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-meter" target="_blank">E-meter</a>" using our arduino's magnet sensor. </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Make sure to include your s4d_breadboard.h file in your project.</li>
        <li>Experiment with the magnetsensor. What happens to the value when the magnet is near? What happens when the magnet is far?<note>Deze eerste twee bullits een andere opdracht laten zijn.</note></li>
        <li>Modify the provided code so the light blinks a bit faster when the magnet is near.</li>
        <li>Can you think of a trick (calculation) that would amplify the difference <note>"amplify difference" lijkt me niet begrijpelijk genoeg.</note>between the sensor being close and far?<note>Try to implement your trick. If that fails, just describe your idea in comments in the program.</note></li>
