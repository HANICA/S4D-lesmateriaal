  <h1>Lesson 1: Arduino</h1>

  <p>The first lesson introduces the Arduino -- a tiny computer that is often used to control all kinds of hardware, including robots, drones and art-installations.</p>

  <p class="attention">Before you start watching the video below, make sure you have a texteditor or a physical notepad ready to use. <b>Write down all the words you did not understand.</b></p>

  <section class="assignment">
    <h3 class="assignment summary">1.1 Create a short summary</h3>
    <p>Make a list with <i>3 to 5 bullitpoints</i>, in which you describe <b>the most important parts on the Arduino</b> which were explained in the video.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="assignment">
      <h3 class="assignment questions">1.2 Things we could explain</h3>
      <p>Refer to the notes you took when watching the video. <b>Which words would you like us to explain during class?</b></p>
  </section>

  <p>The following three video's explain the basics of programming the arduino. Watch them and make the assignments in the order they appear.</p>

  <h2>The Arduino Development Program (IDE)</h2>

  <section class="assignment">
      <h3 class="assignment questions">1.3 Calculations</h3>
      <pre>
      OLED.print(analogRead(POTENTIOMETER) * 4 + 100)
      </pre>
      <p>Given the following code, describe the order in which parts of the command are executed by the arduino</p>
  </section>

   <h2>The S4d Breadboard</h2>

    <section class="assignment">
      <h3 class="assignment questions">1.4 Calculations with magnets</h3>
      <pre>
#include "s4d_breadboard.h"

void setup() {
    initializeBreadboard();
}

void loop() {
  OLED.print(analogRead(MAGNETSENSOR));
  digitalWrite(LED_RED, HIGH);
  delay(500);
  digitalWrite(LED_RED, LOW);
  delay(500);
}
      </pre>
      <p>For the scientology church, we are building their new so called "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-meter" target="_blank">E-meter</a>" using our arduino's magnet sensor. </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Make sure to include your s4d_breadboard.h file in your project.</li>
        <li>Experiment with the magnetsensor. What happens to the value when the magnet is near? What happens when the magnet is far?</li>
        <li>Modify the provided code so the light blinks a bit faster when the magnet is near.</li>
        <li>Can you think of a trick (calculation) that would amplify the difference between the sensor being close and far?</li>
      </ul>
