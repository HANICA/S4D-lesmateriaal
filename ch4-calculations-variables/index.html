    <h3>expressions</h3>
    <script type="text/plain" class="language-javascript" data-line=3>
      var brand = "BMW"
      var type = "Isetta 300"
      var carName = brand + " " + type
      alert( carName )
    </script>
    <p><i>(that's <a href="http://lousmcleod.blogspot.com/2017/07/bmw-isetta-300-mini-caravan.html">this supercar</a>)</i></p>
    <p>Calculations can also be done with pieces of text. Textual data in programs are called <b>strings</b>. The code above creates two variables that have strings ("BMW" and "Isetta 300") as their value. Then, on the highlighted line, it creates a new string by combining those values, with a string containing a single space inbetween. Although the code uses the + symbol, it's not an addition, and we call this operation a <i>string concatenation</i>.</p>
    <p>It is a bit of a stretch to call string concatenations <i>calculations</i>. The better term any piece of code that creates a new value (text, number or other kinds) is <b><i>expression</i></b>.</p> 
    <p>An expression in a variable assignment is everything to the right of the "=" sign. In previous examples, we also used expressions between the parentheses of a function call.  An expression always results in a single value that can be stored in a variable, or used as inputs to a function call like <code>alert("BMW" + " " + "Isetta 300")</code> or <code>console.log(17/4 + 8))</code>.</p>
    
    <h4>mixing text and numeric expressions</h4>
    <p>It is very common in programs to have expressions that mix string concatenations with numeric calculations. Here's an example:</p>
    <script type="text/plain" class="language-javascript">
      var message = "The movie 'The Irishman' is " + ( 3 * 60 + 29 ) + " minutes long."
    </script>
    <p>When you mix text and numeric operations, use parenthesis, i.e. ( and ), to avoid confusion (between + for adding numbers and + for concatenating text).</p>
    </div>
      <section class="assignment">
        <h3>4.4 calculations and strings</h3>
      <p>Take the following code snippet:</p>
      <script type="text/plain" class="language-javascript">
        var lecturer = "Robert"
        var lecturer2 = "Jille"
        var votesForLecturer1 = 29
        var votesForLecturer2 = 30
      </script>
      <p>Add a fifth line that:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Uses the variables above in single expression</li>
        <li>to create the value "Jille is the favourite lecturer after 59 votes were counted. Robert lost by 1 vote.",</li>
        <li>and uses result as the input of an alert.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Tip: Not all quotation marks play well with code. Note the difference between: single quotes (') , double quotes (") and curly quotes (“).  </p>
      <script type="text/plain" class="language-javascript">
        var a = "This is a string"
        var b = 'In javascript this is also a correct string. In arduino it means something different'
        var c = "This is not a string because it ends with a different quote.'
        var d = “This is not a string; it is very easy to accidently introduce these curly quotationmarks when copying code from word, the web or email.”

        Run the code on your arduino. Can you explain the difference in behaviour of the innerCounter and the outerCounter?

  //3. Maka a new variable that calculates the difference between the control value and the current value. Use the abs() function to make the value always be positive. abs(-100) is 100.
  //4. Use arduino's tone(pin, frequency) function to make sound corresponding with the proximity of a magnet. Maybe you need to multiply the difference variable by a factor of 6 or 8 to make machine workable.

        Use the plan in code above to create a magnetdetector in arduino. 
        <ul>
          <li>tone(BUZZER, 1000); //makes a tone at 1000 hertz.</li>
          <li>abs() makes the <i>absolute</i> value from an input. This means abs(-2) is the same as abs(2). If you don't understand where you can use this, don't worry. You can still get a sort of ok solution without it.</li>
